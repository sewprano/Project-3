                Couch Tuber is a streaming search app and is meant to consolidate all of a user's streaming services, 
                allowing them to search for titles among all their streaming services, view all the renewal dates 
                and prices in one place, and, eventually, to browse all the streaming services by genre at the same time, 
                making it easier to find something to watch. 
            </p>

                Couch Tuber was created by Calvin Bauman, Allen Gonzalas, Josue Garza, and Deborah Wade.
